neg = control, can = tumor positive TCRs

**Naïve TCR supposedly have no bias w.r.t to the sampling/distribution for each V-J gene combination**
*Each dataset should have a cropped version*

### dataset1 : 
- neg : Naïve TCR sequences as control
- tumor : Merkel Cell Carcinoma from AdaptiveBiotech, agg from 2 studies
         (Biopsy : _Prevalent and Diverse Intratumoral Oncoprotein-Specific CD8þ T Cells within Polyomavirus-Driven Merkel Cell_)
         (TIL/tumor : KLL+, _Tumor-Infiltrating Merkel Cell PolyomavirusSpecific T Cells Are Diverse and Associated with
Improved Patient Survival_)

### dataset2 :
- neg : naïve tcr 
- tumor : original train/test tumor seqs


### dataset3 :
- Just mix everything lol
